# Actuator Specification

An actuator is a process capable of performing real-world interaction. This
document outlines the states, communications and messages an actuator is
expected to conform to in order to be part of a responsive rooms system.

## Actuator/Master Communication

An actuator may be connected to one, and only one, master process, which may
change and query its state.

### Registration

| Msg.| Prt.| Port  | Description                                              |
|:---:|:---:|:-----:|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|  M  | UDP | 14000 | _Broadcast._ Master node identifier.                     |
| AMR | TCP | 14001 | Actuator type, allowed actions with typed parameters*.   |

\* If a sensor has any facility, room or location data, it will send it to
   master in order to help the master in determining its locality.

      |                 |
      |                 |
```

| Msg.| Prt.| Port  | Description                                              |
|:---:|:---:|:-----:|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| SCU | TCP | 14001 | Facility and room identifiers, optionally locality data*.|
|  A  | TCP | 14001 | Target action and action state.                          |
|  AR | TCP | 14001 | Current action states**.                                 |

\* The message is only sent if necessary, and typically only once.

\** Actuators report at sensible intervals to its master, but at least once
every 29 seconds. An actuator failing to report for 30 seconds will be
considered `unresponsive` for another 30 seconds, after which it is forcibly
deregistered from the master. An `unresponsive` actuator succeeding to send a
report to its master before being deregistered regains normal status.

### De-registration

De-registration occurs by either party terminating the TCP session.

+------------+    +------------+
|  Actuator  |    |   Master   |
